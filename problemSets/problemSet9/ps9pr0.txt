It’s hard for me to imagine using this search feature. This is because although I sometimes remember things with a vague link to the topic, this happens very rarely. Although the times that this does occur, having pivot search would be incredibly helpful. However, this search style would remain relatively unused by me and my interactions with the computer. I do find it believable for lawyers to use this search in order to find relevant cases and information to be used in context. It may not always be applicable, but it is utilitous in many cases. The same for doctors, in very unusual and strange cases, then having a pivot search may be more effective at diagnosis than a human doctor. If the information is available, then it should be used in the most effective way in my opinion if possible .
