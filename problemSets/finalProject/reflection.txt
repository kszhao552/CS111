The sources that I used were the compilation of works of Shakespeare given in the problem set
and four articles from the new york times

I chose to compare them to my wr120 essay over the manchurian candidate, an article from the boston globe,
the christmas carol by Charles Dickens, and the first episode of family guy

All of the text were more likely to come from the nytimes besides the christmas carol.

I think that it works fine overall. However, a better method than the amount of punctuation could be used for determing 
the source. This is because if you compile a lot of text for one source, it's going to have more sentences naturally,
so comparing it to something short like my essay will give the source with less text the advantage.
